# **Cloud Computing**

## **Definition**

Cloud computing is the **delivery of on-demand computing services and resources** over the internet on a **pay-as-you-go** basis.
It provides access to:

* Servers
* Storage
* Databases
* Software platforms
* Applications
* Virtual desktops

**Example/Analogy:**
Think of cloud computing like **renting a house** instead of **buying one**. You use it as long as you need and pay only for the time or space you use. You don’t worry about repairs or maintenance — the landlord (cloud provider) handles that.

## **Problem Solved by Cloud Computing**

Earlier, businesses had to:

* Buy and install **expensive hardware** and servers.
* Pay for **maintenance and upgrades**.
* Face problems if they needed to scale up quickly.

With cloud computing:

* You can **rent** the required computing power and storage.
* **No upfront investment** is needed.
* **Scaling up or down** is easy — just like increasing or decreasing your internet plan.
* Businesses only **pay for what they use**.

## **Disadvantages of Traditional IT Resources**

1. **High initial cost:** Need to buy servers, software, and data centers.
2. **Maintenance overhead:** Regular updates, repairs, and IT staff are required.
3. **Limited scalability:** To handle more work, new hardware must be purchased.
4. **Underutilization:** Hardware often sits idle when demand is low.
5. **Disaster recovery issues:** Backups and recovery are slow and costly.
6. **Limited accessibility:** Systems can be accessed only within the office or network.

**Example:**
A small company buying 10 servers may use only 3 most of the time — the rest stay idle but still cost money.

## **Advantages of Cloud Computing**

1. **Cost-effective:** No need to buy hardware; pay only for what you use.
2. **Scalable:** Resources can grow or shrink instantly as per demand.
3. **Accessible from anywhere:** All you need is an internet connection.
4. **Automatic updates:** Service providers handle updates and security patches.
5. **Data backup and recovery:** Cloud keeps copies of your data automatically.
6. **Better collaboration:** Teams can work on shared documents in real time.
7. **Environmentally friendly:** Uses shared resources, reducing energy waste.

**Example:**
Google Drive lets users store and share files online without worrying about buying storage drives.

## **Challenges in Cloud Computing**

1. **Data security and privacy:** Sensitive data is stored on external servers.
2. **Downtime:** Services depend on internet connectivity.
3. **Limited control:** Users rely on providers for system management.
4. **Compliance issues:** Meeting legal or regional data rules can be difficult.
5. **Vendor lock-in:** Hard to move to another provider if the first one doesn’t suit.
6. **Hidden costs:** Large data transfers or premium services can raise bills.

**Example:**
If a company stores data on AWS, switching to Azure later might require data migration, which can be complex and costly.

## **Types of IT Infrastructure**

| Type                            | Description                                                                                 | Advantages                                                 | Disadvantages                                                 | Example Use Case                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **On-Premises Infrastructure**  | All hardware and software are managed within the organization’s own building.               | Full control, better security, customizable setup.         | High cost, requires maintenance, limited scalability.         | Banks or government offices managing sensitive data internally.             |
| **Cloud Infrastructure**        | Entire infrastructure is managed by a cloud service provider and accessed via the internet. | Low cost, high scalability, no maintenance required.       | Internet dependency, limited control, data security concerns. | Startups or e-commerce companies using AWS or Google Cloud.                 |
| **Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure** | A mix of on-premises and cloud systems working together.                                    | Flexible, secure, supports both sensitive and public data. | More complex setup and integration.                           | Large enterprises combining private data centers with public cloud storage. |

## **Conclusion**

Cloud computing has transformed how organizations manage and use IT resources.
It helps businesses **reduce cost**, **increase flexibility**, and **improve performance** without heavy investments in hardware.
However, challenges like **security, downtime, and vendor dependency** must be managed carefully. Choosing between **on-premises, cloud, or hybrid infrastructure** depends on the organization’s size, security needs, and budget.
